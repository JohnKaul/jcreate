v1.0  - 2026-01-08
==================

- Added CHANGLOG to project for easy reporting of new features.
- Added optional 'media.path' variable in template.conf to override the
  media.path variable set in jcreate.conf. This should allow multiple
  different bases to be used for different types of jails (e.g., "media",
  "tiny", "minimal", "developer", etc. type jails).
- Added a "program version number" to project.
- Added a typical "usage" disply when incorrect number of arguments are given.
- Added ability to run "dry run" (-n option) as user instead of
  requiring elevated permissions.
