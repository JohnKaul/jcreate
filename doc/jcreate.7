.Sh  NAME
jcreate -- a program to create simple jail.conf jails.
.Pp
.Sh  SYNOPSIS
jcreate.sh <template.conf>
.Pp
.Sh  DESCRIPTION
This script will create a `<jailname>.conf` jail configuration file in `/etc/jail.conf.d/`. This script accepts a config file for the "template" you wish to create.
.Pp
This script also has a main configuration file which holds a few necessary variables. The location of the `jcreate.conf` file is located at the same location as the installation directory.
.Pp
To get started creating jails in FreeBSD we need first download the userland for the release you want the jail to have. The instructions to download the userland can be found in the FreeBSD handbook (copied here for convience).
.Pp
.Sh  USERLAND DOWNLOAD (From the FreeBSD Handbook)
In principle, a jail only needs a hostname, a root directory, an IP address, and a userland. The userland for the jail can be obtained from the official FreeBSD download servers. Execute the following command to download the userland
.Bd -literal -offset indent
  # fetch https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/amd64/amd64/13.2-RELEASE/base.txz -o /usr/local/jails/media/13.2-RELEASE-base.txz
.Ed
.Sh  BASIC JAIL CONFIGURATION
The next step is to create a `jail.conf` file in `/etc/`.
.Pp
The `/etc/jail.conf/` should look something like (your needs may very slightly):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
    # DEFAULT OPTIONS
    # (COMMON TO ALL JAILS)
.Pp
    # STARTUP/LOGGING
    exec.start = "/bin/sh /etc/rc";
    exec.stop  = "/bin/sh /etc/rc.shutdown";
    exec.consolelog = "/var/log/jail_console_${name}.log";
.Pp
    # PERMISSIONS
    allow.raw_sockets;
    exec.clean;
    #mount.devfs;
    #devfs_ruleset = 5;
.Pp
    # PATH/HOSTNAME
    path = "/usr/local/jails/containers/${name}";
    host.hostname = "${name}";
.Pp
    # VNET/VIMAGE
    vnet;
    vnet.interface = "${epair}b";
.Pp
    # NETWORKS/INTERFACES
    $ip             =   "192.168.0.${id}/24";
    $epair          =   "epair${id}";
    $gateway        =   "192.168.0.1";
    $bridge         =   "bridge0";
.Pp
    # ADD TO bridge INTERFACE
    exec.prestart   =   "/sbin/ifconfig ${epair} create up";
    exec.prestart   +=  "/sbin/ifconfig ${epair}a up descr jail:${name}";
    exec.prestart   +=  "/sbin/ifconfig ${bridge} addm ${epair}a up";
    exec.start      +=  "/sbin/ifconfig ${epair}b ${ip} up";
    exec.start      +=  "/sbin/route add default ${gateway}";
    exec.poststop   =   "/sbin/ifconfig ${bridge} deletem ${epair}a";
    exec.poststop   +=  "/sbin/ifconfig ${epair}a destroy";
.Pp
    .include "/etc/jail.conf.d/*.conf";

.Pp
.Sh  JCREATE CONFIGURATION
The last steps are to make sure `jcreate.sh` knows where to find the userland we just downloaded.
.Pp
The default `jcreate.conf` confuration file should contain the following variables.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl media.path
A location to where the userland.
.Pp
.It Fl containers.path
A location where to extract the userland (where the jail will reside)
.El
.Pp
Example jcreate.conf:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
    config {
        media.path=/usr/local/jails/media/14.1-RELEASE-base.txz
        containers.path=/usr/local/jails/containers
    }
.Ed
.Sh  TEMPLATE CONFIGURATION
To create a jail `jcreate` needs a few more variables and these are specific to each jail.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl jail.name REQUIRED
The name of the jail
.Pp
.It Fl jail.epairid REQUIRED
This is the last few digits of the jails IP address.
.Pp
.It Fl jail.mounts OPTIONAL
The file which contains the mount locations.
.Pp
.It Fl jail.config OPTIONAL
The configuration script to be copied into the jail and executed.
.Pp
.It Fl  jail.copyin OPTIONAL
Files to copy in reletave to `/usr/local`.
.Pp
.It Fl  jail.mlock=1 OPTIONAL
Allow jail to mlock.
.El
.Pp
Example template.conf:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
    config {
       jail.name=mytemplate
       jail.epairid=64
       jail.mounts=mounts.conf
       jail.confg=mytemplate.sh
    }
.Ed
.Pp
Example mounts.conf:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
    mount += [dir1] [dir1] nulfs 0 0
    mount += [dir2] [dir2] nulfs 0 0

.Sh  EXAMPLE USAGE
